Allele-specific expression analysis

Here is a allele-specific expression predictor.

## Background

Allele-specific expression(ASE) is a phenomena that the abundance of allelic  
copies from the same transcript are different. RNA sequencing gives a chance  
to quantify the divergence between two alleles. 

### ASE is cell type specific
