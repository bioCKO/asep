1. Installation of CADD 1.4
2. Screwed by the following (annotation result lack of)
	- significant classification of variants. (i.e. PATHOGENIC/BENIGN)
		- ClinVar(complex, more than 80 categories)
		- Update the CADD score of old GAVIN annotation file to CADD v1.4 (no significant improvement)
	- allele frequency(i.e. GnomAD)
	- 
3. Machine learning model based on old GAVIN annotation results
	- statistics for gnomAD allele frequency
	- machine learning models
