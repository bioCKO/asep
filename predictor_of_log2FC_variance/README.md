# Introduction
## Note for the construction of medel

# Steps
1. log2FC = log2(alternative_allele_count / reference_allele_count )

# Dicsoveries
1. RNA level
2. Predict precision is bloodly bad!

# Problems
1. For annotation by GAVIN, there is no direct feature corrolated to log2FCVar


# Plan
How about adding gene expression as feature.
